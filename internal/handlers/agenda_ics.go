// TalkPublicICS serves a downloadable .ics file for a single
// scheduled talk so anyone browsing the conf agenda can add the
// session to their personal calendar. Distinct from the per-
// speaker invite (METHOD:REQUEST, addressed to a specific email):
// this is METHOD:PUBLISH with no ATTENDEE list — a one-way "here's
// an event, opt in if you want to" feed.
//
// UID is namespaced under "agenda-" so a recipient who's also a
// speaker doesn't end up with duplicate calendar entries (the
// speaker invite already populated their calendar under a
// different UID).
//
// Path: GET /{conf}/talk/{anchor}/calendar.ics
//
// Returns 404 when the conf or talk isn't found OR when the
// talk's scheduled end is already in the past — back-dated
// downloads aren't useful and would just clutter calendars.
